            <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
            <p>
                Arngren.net is a cluttered, outdated website where the layout is chaotic, colors clash, and alignment is non-existent.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The colors blend together, making text hard to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition: No consistent use of fonts, colors, or design patterns.</li>
                <li>Alignment: Items are randomly placed with no structure.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Related items are not grouped, making it confusing to navigate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Assessment: This site does not follow any of the CRAP principles well, resulting in a visually confusing experience.
